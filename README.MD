#Web Scraping Automation Project
This project automates data extraction from websites, using web scraping techniques to gather and store data efficiently. It reduces the need for manual data collection, saving time and effort. The data is extracted, processed, and saved in structured formats suitable for analysis or reporting.
Features
•	Automated Data Extraction: Uses Selenium to navigate and extract data from websites dynamically.
•	Data Processing: Pandas is used to clean, organize, and transform the scraped data.
•	Excel Integration: Uses OpenPyXL to export data to Excel files for easy sharing and analysis.
Technologies Used
•	Selenium: For browser automation and navigating complex website structures.
•	Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and organization.
•	OpenPyXL: For writing data into Excel files.
Prerequisites
•	Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed.
•	Web Driver: Install a compatible WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome).
•	Required Libraries: Install libraries using pip.
bash
Copy code
pip install selenium pandas openpyxl
Setup and Usage
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Manish2102/WebScrapping.git
2.	Navigate to the project directory:
cd webScraping
3.	Run the script:
python main.py
Project Structure
•	main.py: Main script that handles data scraping, processing, and exporting.
•	data/: Folder where the output Excel files are saved.
•	requirements.txt: File containing all dependencies.
Workflow
1.	Scraping: The script navigates through the target website using Selenium to extract specific data points.
2.	Data Cleaning: Extracted data is processed with Pandas, ensuring it's structured and ready for analysis.
3.	Export to Excel: Final data is written to an Excel file using OpenPyXL.
