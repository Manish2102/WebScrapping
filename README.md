#Web Scraping Automation Project
This project automates data extraction from websites, using web scraping techniques to gather and store data efficiently. It reduces the need for manual data collection, saving time and effort. The data is extracted, processed, and saved in structured formats suitable for analysis or reporting.

Features
Automated Data Extraction: Uses Selenium to navigate and extract data from websites dynamically.
Data Processing: Pandas is used to clean, organize, and transform the scraped data.
Excel Integration: Uses OpenPyXL to export data to Excel files for easy sharing and analysis.
Technologies Used
Selenium: For browser automation and navigating complex website structures.
Pandas: For data manipulation, cleaning, and organization.
OpenPyXL: For writing data into Excel files.
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: Ensure Python is installed.

Web Driver: Install a compatible WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome).

Required Libraries: Install libraries using pip.


pip install selenium pandas openpyxl
